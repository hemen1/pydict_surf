# pydict_surf
Performs a walk over all fields of json and python dictionary.  Works almost same as `os.walk`

A toolkit to route inside a nested dictionary and list.
The item is specifically designed for routing inside a json dictionary. It can route inside a
key, outside it, and to a specific address. The class is also capable of updating and reading
keys. The usage of this class is almost like the os command system as it has `chdict` (instead of
chdir), `pwdict` (instead of pwd), etc
